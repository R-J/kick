# Kick

This plugin is for those forums where user's communication skills are too retarded to start a normal conversation. Instead of saying "Hi" they can lazily press a button for that - you might know that "poke" feature from facebook...
The plugin adds a button to user profiles, next to the message button. On pressing that button, the profile user gets a notification. The notification preferences can be set as other notification preferences under `/profile/preferences`. If user chose not to be notified, the button will not appear on his profile.
